\section{Conclusions}
In this empirical analysis, we observed that Union-Find is a powerful data structure with efficient operations and a strong amortized cost. We also saw that time performance and metric gathering may not always be correlated (or perhaps they are, but we need a larger input size to confirm this).  

Additionally, we studied a new path compression technique that is not as popular as Full Compression, Path Splitting, or Path Halving. At first glance, it appeared promising, but the metrics did not show any significant improvement.  

Future work with larger input sizes is also promising in order to determine when the \( \log n \) factor becomes noticeable compared to the inverse Ackermann function.
