\section{Analysis of Interleaver Insertions and Deletions}
Knuth in the volume $3$ of his well-known book \textit{The Art of Computer Programming} \cite{knuth1998art} mentioned that, indeed, random insertions and deletions \textit{destroys} the randomness of a BST. This fact was firstly observed by Gary Knott in 1972 and, later on, Eppinger \cite{eppinger1983empirical} showed expeerimentally that the path length, although at the beginning it decreases slightly, increases and reaches a stability after doing a quadratic number of deletions/insertions.

Although Knuth also mentioned that still we lack of a theoretical explanation
